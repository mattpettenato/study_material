// Why JavaScript? 
// - compliment to Java Applets, for little animations
// - vaguely similar syntax to Java
// - lightweight and simple: no classes, no integers

// AJAX

// With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page.

// - allows website to communicate with server asynchronously
