3 key terms

Complexity Analysis
- the process of detemrining how efficient an algorithm is. 
- Complexity analysis usually involves finding both the time complexity and the space complexity of an algorithm.
- Complexity analysis is effectively how 'good' an algorithm is and whther its 'better' than another one.

Time Complexity
- A measure of how fast an algorithm runs, time complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews.
- It's expressed using Big O notation

Space Complexity
- A measure of how much auxilary memory an algorithm takes up, space complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithm and in coding interviews.
- It's expressed using Big O notation
